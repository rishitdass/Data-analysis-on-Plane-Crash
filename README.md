# Airplane Crashes Data Analytics and Visualization

This repository contains a data analytics and visualization project on airplane crashes between 1908 and 2008. The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques to gain insights into airplane crash patterns and fatalities.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing any duplicates or irrelevant entries.

2. **Crash Count Over the Years**: A line plot was generated to visualize the trend of airplane crash occurrences over the years. This analysis provides insights into the overall pattern of airplane crashes throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries.

3. **Fatality Analysis**: 
   - A pie chart was created to illustrate the distribution of fatalities versus survivors across all recorded airplane crashes. This visualization highlights the proportion of fatalities compared to the number of survivors.
   - Ground fatalities were examined separately to understand the impact of airplane crashes on the ground. 
   - A pie chart comparison was made between ground fatalities resulting from the 9/11 attacks and ground fatalities from other airplane crashes, offering insights into the severity of ground fatalities in different scenarios.

4. **Fatalities and Abroad Passengers**: A graph was created to depict the relationship between fatalities and the number of passengers abroad. This visualization helps understand the correlation between these two variables in airplane crashes.

5. **Most Crashes and Fatalities by Operator**: Graphs were generated to identify the operators with the highest number of crashes and fatalities. This analysis sheds light on the safety records of different airline operators.

6. **Fatalities and Crashes by Military and Civilian**: The fatalities and crash counts were compared between military and civilian aircraft. This comparison provides insights into the safety performance of military and civilian aviation sectors.

## Key Observations

- The trend of airplane crashes shows fluctuations over the years, with certain periods experiencing higher frequencies of crashes.
- The pie chart of fatalities versus survivors demonstrates the significant impact of airplane crashes, with a considerable portion of individuals succumbing to injuries.
- Analysis of ground fatalities reveals the broader implications of airplane crashes beyond onboard passengers and crew members. Approximately 2/3 of ground fatalities are attributed to the 9/11 attacks, indicating the scale and severity of this event.
- The comparison between ground fatalities in the 9/11 attacks and other crashes sheds light on the unique circumstances and consequences of terrorist-related incidents.
- The graph depicting fatalities and the number of passengers abroad helps understand the relationship between these variables in the context of airplane crashes.
- Identification of operators with the highest crash and fatality counts provides insights into safety performance and potential areas for improvement. AEROFLOT stands out as the operator responsible for the most fatalities and deaths, highlighting areas for further investigation and safety improvement.
- Comparison of fatalities and crash counts between military and civilian aircraft offers a glimpse into the safety records of different aviation sectors. There was a tremendous increase in military crashes and fatalities during World War II, underscoring the unique challenges and risks faced by military aviation during wartime.

## Instructions for Reproduction

To reproduce the analysis and visualizations:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
4. View the generated plots in the `plots/` directory to visualize the results.
